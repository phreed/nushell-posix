== Guide Structure

This guide is organized into three main sections:

**Foundation**::
Understanding the project context, current status, and overall architecture.
(<<problem-description>>, <<project-status>>, <<architecture-overview>>)

**Implementation**::
Deep dive into the technical implementation details of parsers, converters, and command registries.
(<<parser-integration>>, <<converter-architecture>>, <<command-registry>>, <<builtin-converters>>, <<sus-converters>>, <<awk-converter>>)

**Development**::
Practical guidance for testing, development workflows, and API usage.
(<<converter-verification>>, <<testing-framework>>, <<development-guide>>, <<api-reference>>)

== Overview

This developer guide provides comprehensive technical documentation for contributing to and extending the nu-posix project. It covers the internal architecture, development workflows, testing frameworks, and API references needed to work with the codebase effectively.

== Target Audience

This guide is intended for:

* **Core Contributors**: Developers working on the nu-posix codebase
* **Plugin Developers**: Those extending nu-posix with custom converters
* **Library Users**: Developers integrating nu-posix into other projects
* **Technical Maintainers**: Those responsible for project maintenance and releases

== Prerequisites

Before using this guide, you should have:

* Experience with Rust programming language
* Familiarity with Nushell plugin development
* Understanding of POSIX shell scripting
* Knowledge of parsing and AST concepts
* Basic understanding of compiler design principles

== Quick Start for Developers

=== Environment Setup

1. **Install Rust toolchain**:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   ```

2. **Clone and build**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nushell/nu-posix.git
   cd nu-posix
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   cargo clippy
   ```

=== Key Development Commands

```bash
# Watch for changes during development
cargo watch -x test

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Generate documentation
cargo doc --open

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run performance benchmarks
cargo bench
```

== Architecture Quick Reference

=== Core Components

```
nu-posix/
├── Parser System
│   ├── yash-syntax integration (primary)
│   └── Heuristic parser (fallback)
├── Converter System
│   ├── Command Registry
│   ├── Builtin Converters
│   ├── SUS Converters
│   └── External Converters
├── AST Definitions
│   ├── POSIX AST types
│   └── Conversion utilities
└── Plugin Interface
    ├── Nushell integration
    └── Command definitions
```

=== Key Traits and Interfaces

* **`CommandConverter`**: Interface for implementing command converters
* **`Parser`**: Interface for POSIX script parsing
* **`Registry`**: Management of converter instances
* **`Plugin`**: Nushell plugin integration

=== Data Flow

```
POSIX Script → Parser → AST → Converter → Nushell Code
     ↓             ↓        ↓         ↓
  String input → Tokenize → Transform → String output
```

== Testing Strategy

=== Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
3. **Regression Tests**: Prevent known issues from recurring
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark conversion speed and memory usage
5. **Compatibility Tests**: Ensure POSIX compliance

=== Test Coverage Goals

* **Parser**: 95%+ coverage of POSIX constructs
* **Converters**: 90%+ coverage of command variations
* **Registry**: 100% coverage of management operations
* **Plugin**: 85%+ coverage of Nushell integration

== Performance Considerations

=== Optimization Targets

* **Parsing Speed**: < 1ms for simple commands, < 10ms for complex scripts
* **Memory Usage**: < 1MB for typical scripts
* **Conversion Accuracy**: 99%+ semantic correctness
* **Startup Time**: < 100ms plugin initialization

=== Profiling Guidelines

Use these tools to identify performance bottlenecks:

```bash
# CPU profiling
cargo flamegraph --test integration_test

# Memory profiling
valgrind --tool=massif target/release/nu-posix

# Benchmarking
cargo bench --bench conversion_performance
```

== Contributing Guidelines

=== Code Standards

* Follow Rust idioms and conventions
* Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting
* Address all `clippy` warnings
* Write comprehensive documentation
* Include tests for new functionality

=== Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement changes with tests
4. Run full test suite
5. Submit PR with clear description
6. Address review feedback
7. Merge after approval

=== Release Process

1. Update version numbers
2. Run comprehensive test suite
3. Update documentation
4. Create release notes
5. Tag and publish release
6. Update dependent projects

== Troubleshooting Development Issues

=== Common Problems

* **Build Failures**: Check Rust version and dependencies
* **Test Failures**: Ensure test environment is clean
* **Performance Issues**: Profile before optimizing
* **Memory Leaks**: Use sanitizers and profiling tools

=== Debugging Techniques

* Enable debug logging with `RUST_LOG=debug`
* Use `cargo expand` to examine macro expansions
* Add `dbg!()` statements for quick debugging
* Use IDE debugger for step-through debugging

== Future Development

=== Planned Features

* Complete yash-syntax integration
* Enhanced error reporting
* Performance optimizations
* Additional POSIX utility support
* IDE language server integration

=== Extension Points

* Custom converter plugins
* Alternative parser backends
* Output format customization
* Integration with other shells

== Conclusion

This developer guide provides the technical foundation needed to contribute effectively to the nu-posix project. The modular architecture, comprehensive testing framework, and clear APIs make it straightforward to extend and maintain the system.
