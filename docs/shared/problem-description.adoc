== Overview

The proliferation of POSIX shell scripts in system administration, DevOps, and automation has created a significant challenge for users transitioning to modern shells like Nushell. While Nushell offers superior data handling, type safety, and pipeline semantics, the vast ecosystem of existing POSIX shell scripts represents a substantial investment that cannot be easily abandoned.

== The Shell Transition Challenge

=== Legacy Script Investment

Organizations and individuals have accumulated thousands of POSIX shell scripts over decades, representing:

* Critical system automation
* Deployment pipelines
* Configuration management
* Monitoring and alerting systems
* Data processing workflows

These scripts embody institutional knowledge and proven workflows that are difficult to recreate from scratch.

=== POSIX Shell Limitations

Traditional POSIX shells suffer from several fundamental limitations:

==== Data Handling
* **Text-based Everything**: All data is treated as strings, requiring extensive parsing
* **No Type Safety**: Variables have no inherent type information
* **Error-prone Processing**: Complex text manipulation is fragile and hard to maintain

==== Pipeline Semantics
* **Unstructured Data Flow**: Pipelines pass untyped text streams
* **Limited Composition**: Difficult to build complex data transformations
* **Poor Error Handling**: Errors often go unnoticed or are handled inconsistently

== Technical Foundation: AST Mapping

=== Understanding Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)

An AST is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language.
Each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.
The structure of an AST is crucial because it captures the hierarchical relationships and logical flow of the code,
making it suitable for analysis, transformation, and compilation.

Mapping two different ASTs involves translating the constructs and
relationships from one language's syntax tree into another's.
This is particularly challenging when the underlying paradigms of the languages differ significantly,
as is the case with traditional POSIX shells and Nushell.

=== POSIX AST (yash-syntax) Overview

A POSIX shell's AST, like one generated by yash-syntax,
reflects the traditional Unix philosophy of "everything is a string" and "pipes connect streams of text."

Key constructs typically found in a POSIX AST include:

==== Command
A simple command consists of a command name and its arguments.

==== Pipeline
A sequence of one or more commands connected by pipes (|). The output of one command becomes the input of the next.

==== Redirection
Changing the input/output streams of a command (e.g., `command > file`, `command < file`, `command 2>&1`).

==== List/Sequence
A series of commands executed sequentially, often separated by `;` or `&` (for background execution).

==== Conditional Statements
`if-then-else-fi` blocks.

==== Looping Constructs
`for`, `while`, `until` loops.

==== Function Definitions
Defining shell functions.

==== Variable Assignments
`VAR=value`.

==== Subshells
Commands executed in a new shell environment `(commands)`.

==== Command Substitution
`$(command)` or `\`command\``.

==== Arithmetic Expansion
`$((expression))`.

==== Parameter Expansion
`${VAR}`, `${VAR:-default}`, etc.

==== Logical Operators
`&&` (AND), `||` (OR) for conditional execution.

=== Nu AST (nushell) Overview

Nushell's AST reflects its core philosophy of "everything is structured data."
While it supports traditional shell-like operations,
its internal representation emphasizes typed values, tables, and blocks.

Key constructs in a Nu AST include:

==== Command
Similar to POSIX, but arguments can be structured (e.g., flags, named arguments).

==== Pipeline
A sequence of commands,
but the output of one command is structured data (e.g., a table, a list, a record) that becomes the structured input of the next.

==== Block
A collection of statements or expressions, often used in control flow, custom commands, or closures.

==== Expression
Any construct that evaluates to a value (e.g., literals, variable access, function calls, arithmetic operations).

==== Literal
Primitive values like numbers, strings, booleans, lists, records, paths.

==== Variable Definition/Assignment
`let var = value`, `mut var = value`.

==== Control Flow
`if-else`, `for` loops, `loop`, `match`.

==== Custom Command Definition
`def command_name [params] { body }`.

==== Table/Record Literals
Direct representation of structured data.

==== Closures
Anonymous blocks of code.

==== Redirection (Implicit/Explicit)
While Nu has `> file`, `>> file`, `| save file`, its primary data flow is through structured pipelines.

=== Mapping Challenges

The primary challenges in mapping POSIX to Nu AST arise from their fundamental differences:

==== Data Paradigm
* **POSIX**: Text-stream-oriented. All data is essentially a string, and parsing happens at each command.
* **Nu**: Structured-data-oriented. Data flows as typed values (tables, lists, records, primitives) through the pipeline.
* **Challenge**: How to translate POSIX's string-based input/output into Nu's structured data. This often requires explicit parsing or interpretation in Nu.

==== Implicit vs. Explicit Structure
* **POSIX**: Structure is often implicit (e.g., whitespace separation for arguments).
* **Nu**: Structure is explicit (e.g., named arguments, flags, table columns).
* **Challenge**: Inferring Nu's explicit structure from POSIX's implicit one.

==== Command vs. Expression
* **POSIX**: Almost everything is a command.
* **Nu**: Distinguishes between commands (which operate on data) and expressions (which evaluate to data).
* **Challenge**: Deciding when a POSIX command maps to a Nu command and when it maps to an expression.

==== Feature Discrepancies
* **Nu-specific features**: Custom commands, record/table literals, advanced data manipulation commands (e.g., `group-by`, `pivot`). These have no direct POSIX equivalent.
* **POSIX-specific features**: Complex parameter expansions, arithmetic expansion, specific redirection types. These might require complex Nu equivalents or be untranslatable.

=== Proposed Mapping Strategy

A mapping strategy involves a recursive traversal of the POSIX AST, transforming each node into its Nu equivalent:

==== Direct Equivalents
Some constructs have relatively direct mappings:
* **Simple Command**: POSIX `CommandNode(name, args)` → Nu `Call(name, args)`
* **Pipeline**: POSIX `PipelineNode(cmd1, cmd2, ...)` → Nu `Pipeline(cmd1_nu, cmd2_nu, ...)`
* **Variable Assignment**: POSIX `AssignmentNode(name, value)` → Nu `LetNode(name, value_expr)`

==== Structural Transformations
* **Redirections**: POSIX `Command > file` → Nu `Command | save file`
* **Conditional Statements**: POSIX conditions based on command exit codes → Nu boolean expressions
* **Loops**: Similar transformation challenges with condition handling

==== Semantic Translations
* **Command Substitution**: POSIX `$(command)` → Nu `(command_nu)` with data type considerations
* **Arithmetic Expansion**: POSIX `$((expression))` → Nu `(expression_nu)` with type awareness
* **Parameter Expansion**: Various POSIX patterns mapped to Nu string operations
