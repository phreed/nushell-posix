=== Current Features

==== Plugin Architecture
- Nushell plugin structure using `nu-plugin` crate
- Two main commands: `from posix`, `parse posix`
- Compatible with Nushell 0.105+

==== POSIX Parser
- Dual-parser architecture: yash-syntax primary, heuristic fallback
- Handles commands, pipelines, and control structures
- Parses variable assignments and operators
- Supports comments and empty lines
- AST generation for complex script analysis

==== Command Conversion Architecture
- Hierarchical conversion system with prioritized registries:
  * Builtin Registry: Shell built-in commands (first priority)
  * SUS Registry: External utilities (second priority)
  * Legacy Fallback: Remaining commands (third priority)
- Proper separation of POSIX shell builtins from external utilities

==== POSIX Shell Builtin Converters
- `cd` with `-L`/`-P` flags for logical/physical paths
- `exit` with status code handling
- `false` and `true` built-ins
- `jobs` with filtering and formatting options
- `kill` with signal handling and job specifications
- `pwd` with logical/physical path options
- `read` with prompts, variables, and timeout support
- `test` and `[` with full conditional expression support

==== SUS External Utility Converters
- `cat` → `open --raw` with file handling
- `ls` with comprehensive flag mapping
- `grep` → `where` with regex pattern matching
- `find` → `ls` with filtering and search operations
- `sed` → string operations with pattern replacement
- `head`/`tail` → `first`/`last` with count options
- `wc` → `length` with word/line/character counting
- `cut` → field and character extraction
- `date` → date operations with format conversion
- `echo` → `print` with flag handling
- `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` with option mapping
- `sort`, `uniq`, `rmdir`, `chmod`, `chown` with comprehensive flag support
- `awk` with external command execution
- **30 SUS commands** with full flag support

==== Pipeline Conversion
- Basic pipeline transformation (`cmd1 | cmd2`)
- AND/OR operators (`&&` → `and`, `||` → `or`)

==== Control Structures
- Basic if/then/else statements
- Simple for loops
- Variable assignments

==== Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 73+ tests
- Individual test coverage for all builtin and SUS converters
- Parser tests for both yash-syntax and heuristic approaches
- Conversion tests for complex command patterns
- Registry system tests for proper command routing

=== Current Limitations

==== Parser Capabilities
- Some advanced shell constructs may fall back to heuristic parsing
- Complex nested structures may need additional handling
- Advanced parameter expansion patterns require refinement

==== Conversion Scope
- 30 SUS commands with comprehensive flag support
- 9 shell builtins with full POSIX compliance
- Advanced shell features have limited support:
  * Complex parameter expansion
  * Here-documents
  * Background processes
  * Function definitions with parameters
  * Complex case statements

==== Test Coverage
- Some edge cases may need additional test coverage
- Integration tests for full converter pipeline
- Performance testing for large scripts
