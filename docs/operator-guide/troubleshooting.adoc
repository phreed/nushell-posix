= Chapter 15: Troubleshooting

== Overview

This chapter provides comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for common issues encountered when using the nu-posix plugin. It covers installation problems, conversion errors, performance issues, and provides solutions for various edge cases.

== Installation Issues

=== Plugin Registration Problems

==== Symptom
```
Error: Plugin not found: nu-posix
```

==== Solutions

1. **Verify Plugin Build**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ls -la target/release/nu-posix
   ```

2. **Check Plugin Registration**
   ```nu
   plugin list | where name =~ "nu-posix"
   ```

3. **Re-register Plugin**
   ```nu
   plugin rm nu-posix
   plugin add target/release/nu-posix
   plugin use nu-posix
   ```

==== Symptom
```
Error: Plugin failed to load
```

==== Solutions

1. **Check Nushell Version Compatibility**
   ```nu
   version
   ```
   Ensure you're using Nushell 0.105 or compatible version.

2. **Verify Plugin Dependencies**
   ```bash
   ldd target/release/nu-posix  # Linux
   otool -L target/release/nu-posix  # macOS
   ```

3. **Rebuild Plugin**
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   cargo build --release
   ```

=== Compilation Errors

==== Symptom
```
error: failed to compile nu-posix
```

==== Solutions

1. **Update Rust Toolchain**
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustup default stable
   ```

2. **Check Cargo.toml Dependencies**
   Ensure all dependencies are compatible and up-to-date.

3. **Clear Cargo Cache**
   ```bash
   cargo clean
   rm -rf ~/.cargo/registry/cache
   ```

== Conversion Errors

=== Parse Errors

==== Symptom
```
Error: Parse error: unexpected token
```

==== Common Causes and Solutions

1. **Malformed Shell Syntax**
   - **Problem**: Invalid POSIX shell syntax
   - **Solution**: Fix the original shell script or use fallback parser

2. **Unsupported Shell Features**
   - **Problem**: Advanced bash/zsh features not supported
   - **Solution**: Use simpler POSIX-compatible syntax

3. **Complex Quoting Issues**
   - **Problem**: Complex nested quotes confuse parser
   - **Solution**: Simplify quoting or escape manually

==== Example Fix
```bash
# Original (problematic)
echo "He said \"Hello '$USER'\" to me"

# Fixed
echo "He said \"Hello \$USER\" to me"
```

=== Conversion Errors

==== Symptom
```
Error: Conversion error: unsupported command
```

==== Solutions

1. **Check Command Registry**
   ```nu
   from posix --help
   ```

2. **Use External Command Fallback**
   Most unsupported commands fall back to external execution automatically.

3. **Add Custom Converter**
   For frequently used commands, consider implementing a custom converter.

==== Symptom
```
Error: Registry error: converter not found
```

==== Solutions

1. **Verify Plugin Installation**
   ```nu
   plugin list | where name =~ "nu-posix"
   ```

2. **Check Command Spelling**
   Ensure the command name is spelled correctly.

3. **Update Plugin**
   ```nu
   plugin rm nu-posix
   plugin add target/release/nu-posix
   plugin use nu-posix
   ```

== Performance Issues

=== Slow Conversion

==== Symptom
Conversion takes unexpectedly long time.

==== Solutions

1. **Check Script Size**
   Large scripts may require more processing time.

2. **Profile Performance**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --features profiling
   time nu -c '"large_script.sh" | open | from posix'
   ```

3. **Use Batch Processing**
   For multiple files, process them in batches.

4. **Optimize Script Content**
   Complex constructs may slow down parsing.

=== Memory Usage

==== Symptom
High memory usage during conversion.

==== Solutions

1. **Process Scripts in Chunks**
   ```nu
   "large_script.sh" | open | lines | each { |line| $line | from posix }
   ```

2. **Use Streaming Processing**
   For very large files, process line by line.

3. **Monitor Memory Usage**
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   valgrind --tool=memcheck ./target/release/nu-posix
   ```

== Output Issues

=== Incorrect Nu Syntax

==== Symptom
Generated Nushell code doesn't work as expected.

==== Solutions

1. **Verify Original Script**
   Ensure the original POSIX script is correct.

2. **Check Conversion Logic**
   ```nu
   "echo hello" | from posix
   ```

3. **Test Step by Step**
   Break down complex scripts into smaller parts.

4. **Use Pretty Printing**
   ```nu
   "complex_script.sh" | open | from posix --pretty
   ```

=== Missing Features

==== Symptom
Some shell features are not converted.

==== Solutions

1. **Check Feature Support**
   Review documentation for supported features.

2. **Use Alternative Syntax**
   Replace unsupported features with supported equivalents.

3. **Manual Conversion**
   For complex features, manual conversion may be necessary.

== AWK-Specific Issues

=== AWK Scripts Not Working

==== Symptom
```
Error: AWK script fails to execute
```

==== Solutions

1. **Check AWK Installation**
   ```bash
   which awk
   awk --version
   ```

2. **Verify Argument Quoting**
   ```nu
   "awk '{ print $1 }' file.txt" | from posix
   ```

3. **Test AWK Script Directly**
   ```bash
   awk '{ print $1 }' file.txt
   ```

=== Complex AWK Programs

==== Symptom
Complex AWK programs produce incorrect results.

==== Solutions

1. **Simplify AWK Script**
   Break complex scripts into smaller parts.

2. **Use External Files**
   ```bash
   awk -f script.awk data.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Input Data**
   Ensure input data format matches AWK expectations.

== Registry Issues

=== Command Not Found

==== Symptom
```
Error: Command 'xyz' not found in registry
```

==== Solutions

1. **Check Available Commands**
   ```nu
   # List all available converters
   plugin list | where name =~ "nu-posix"
   ```

2. **Use External Command**
   Commands not in registry are handled as external commands.

3. **Verify Command Name**
   Ensure the command name is spelled correctly.

=== Converter Conflicts

==== Symptom
Wrong converter is used for a command.

==== Solutions

1. **Check Registry Priority**
   Builtin converters have priority over SUS converters.

2. **Use Explicit Conversion**
   ```nu
   "ls -la" | from posix  # Uses builtin registry first
   ```

3. **Debug Registry Lookup**
   Enable debug logging to see converter selection.

== Debug Techniques

=== Enable Debug Logging

```nu
$env.RUST_LOG = "debug"
"script.sh" | open | from posix
```

=== Use Verbose Output

```nu
"script.sh" | open | from posix --pretty
```

=== Step-by-Step Debugging

```nu
# Parse only
"script.sh" | open | parse posix

# Convert specific command
"echo hello" | from posix

# Test individual converter
"ls -la" | from posix
```

=== Test with Simple Cases

```nu
# Start with simple cases
"echo hello" | from posix

# Gradually increase complexity
"echo hello | grep h" | from posix
```

== Performance Optimization

=== Conversion Speed

1. **Use Simpler Syntax**
   Avoid complex shell constructs when possible.

2. **Batch Processing**
   Process multiple files together.

3. **Incremental Conversion**
   Convert scripts in parts for large files.

=== Memory Usage

1. **Process Line by Line**
   ```nu
   "large_script.sh" | open | lines | each { |line| $line | from posix }
   ```

2. **Use Streaming**
   Avoid loading entire files into memory.

3. **Clear Variables**
   ```nu
   let result = ("script.sh" | open | from posix)
   $result
   ```

== Best Practices

=== Script Preparation

1. **Validate Original Scripts**
   Ensure POSIX compatibility before conversion.

2. **Use Standard Syntax**
   Avoid shell-specific extensions.

3. **Test Incrementally**
   Convert and test small parts first.

=== Conversion Process

1. **Start Simple**
   Begin with basic commands and pipelines.

2. **Verify Results**
   Test converted Nu code before using.

3. **Document Changes**
   Keep track of manual modifications.

=== Error Handling

1. **Expect Fallbacks**
   Some commands will use external execution.

2. **Validate Output**
   Always test converted code.

3. **Have Backups**
   Keep original scripts as backup.

== Conclusion

This troubleshooting guide covers the most common issues encountered when using nu-posix. For issues not covered here, consider:

1. Checking the latest documentation
2. Searching existing GitHub issues
3. Creating a new issue with detailed reproduction steps
4. Consulting the Nushell community

Remember that nu-posix is designed to handle the most common POSIX shell patterns. For complex or unusual constructs, manual conversion may be necessary.

The key to successful troubleshooting is to:
- Start with simple test cases
- Verify each step of the conversion process
- Use debug output to understand what's happening
- Test converted code thoroughly before deployment

Most issues can be resolved by following the systematic approach outlined in this chapter.
