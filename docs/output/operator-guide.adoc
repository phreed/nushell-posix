"cat file.txt | grep pattern" | from posix

# Convert complex script
open script.sh | from posix | save converted_script.nu

# Parse script to see AST
"echo hello" | parse posix
```

=== Common Use Cases

1. **DevOps Script Migration**:
   ```nu
   # Convert build script
   open build.sh | from posix | save build.nu

   # Convert deployment script
   open deploy.sh | from posix | save deploy.nu
   ```

2. **System Administration**:
   ```nu
   # Convert maintenance scripts
   ls /scripts/*.sh | each { |file|
       open $file | from posix | save ($file | str replace .sh .nu)
   }
   ```

3. **Interactive Conversion**:

brew install nu-posix

# Arch Linux (when available)
yay -S nu-posix
```

=== Verification

After installation, verify everything works:

```nu
# Check plugin is loaded
plugin list | where name == "nu-posix"

# Test basic functionality
"echo test" | from posix

# Test parsing
"ls -la" | parse posix

# Check version
version | get nu-posix
```

== Configuration

=== Plugin Configuration

nu-posix can be configured through environment variables:

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export RUST_LOG=nu_posix=debug

# Configure parser preferences
export NU_POSIX_PREFER_YASH=true
export NU_POSIX_STRICT_POSIX=false
```

=== Nushell Configuration

Add to your Nushell config file (`$nu.config-path`):

```nu
# Auto-load nu-posix plugin
plugin use nu-posix

# Create aliases for common operations
alias posix-convert = from posix
alias posix-parse = parse posix
alias posix-to-nu = from posix
```

== Usage Patterns

=== Script Migration Workflow

1. **Assessment Phase**:
   ```nu
   # Analyze existing scripts
   ls scripts/*.sh | each { |file|
       {
           file: $file,
           lines: (open $file | lines | length),
           complexity: (open $file | parse posix | get commands | length)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Conversion Phase**:
   ```nu
   # Convert scripts with verification
   ls scripts/*.sh | each { |file|
       let converted = (open $file | from posix)
       $converted | save ($file | str replace .sh .nu)

       # Verify conversion
       try {
           nu -c $converted
           {file: $file, status: "success"}
       } catch {
           {file: $file, status: "failed", error: $in}
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Testing Phase**:
   ```nu
   # Test converted scripts
   ls scripts/*.nu | each { |file|
       print $"Testing ($file)..."
       nu -c $"source ($file); main"
   }
   ```

=== Batch Processing

```nu
# Convert multiple files
def convert-scripts [directory: string] {
    ls $"($directory)/*.sh" | each { |file|
        let output = ($file.name | str replace .sh .nu)
        open $file.name | from posix | save $output
        print $"Converted ($file.name) -> ($output)"
    }
}

# Usage
convert-scripts "scripts"
```

=== Pipeline Integration

```nu
# Integration with existing Nushell workflows
open scripts.json
| get scripts
| each { |script|
    $script.content | from posix
}
| save converted-scripts.nu
```

== Best Practices

=== Script Conversion

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic scripts before tackling complex ones
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test converted scripts before deployment
3. **Incremental Migration**: Convert scripts gradually, not all at once
4. **Backup Originals**: Keep original POSIX scripts as reference
5. **Document Changes**: Note any manual adjustments needed

=== Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Operations**: Convert multiple files together when possible
2. **Memory Management**: For large scripts, consider splitting into smaller chunks
3. **Caching**: Cache frequently converted patterns
4. **Parallel Processing**: Use Nushell's parallel processing for large batches

=== Error Handling

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle conversion failures gracefully
2. **Logging**: Enable appropriate logging levels for debugging
3. **Validation**: Verify converted scripts work as expected
4. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan to revert if conversion fails

== Production Deployment

=== CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Convert Scripts
on: [push]
jobs:
  convert:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Install Nushell
      run: cargo install nu
    - name: Install nu-posix
      run: |
        git clone https://github.com/nushell/nu-posix.git
        cd nu-posix
        cargo build --release
        nu -c "plugin add target/release/nu-posix"
    - name: Convert scripts
      run: |
        nu -c "
          ls scripts/*.sh | each { |file|
            open $file | from posix | save ($file | str replace .sh .nu)
          }
        "
```

=== Docker Integration

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for nu-posix
FROM rust:1.70 as builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nushell
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/nu-posix /usr/local/bin/
RUN nu -c "plugin add /usr/local/bin/nu-posix"

ENTRYPOINT ["nu"]
```

=== Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Track conversion speed and success rates
2. **Error Tracking**: Monitor conversion failures and common issues
3. **Updates**: Keep nu-posix updated with latest improvements
4. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation of conversion patterns

== Security Considerations

=== Input Validation

* Always validate POSIX scripts before conversion
* Be cautious with scripts from untrusted sources
* Use sandboxed environments for testing converted scripts

=== Output Verification

* Verify converted scripts don't introduce security vulnerabilities
* Check for unintended command modifications
* Validate file permissions and access patterns

=== Environment Security

* Use appropriate file permissions for converted scripts
* Secure plugin installation and updates
* Monitor for unusual conversion patterns

== Migration Strategies

=== Gradual Migration

1. **Phase 1**: Convert non-critical utility scripts
2. **Phase 2**: Convert automation scripts with thorough testing
3. **Phase 3**: Convert critical system scripts with rollback plans
4. **Phase 4**: Full migration with monitoring

=== Parallel Operation

* Run both POSIX and Nushell versions during transition
* Compare outputs to ensure consistency
* Gradually phase out POSIX versions

=== Training and Adoption

* Train team members on Nushell and nu-posix
* Provide conversion guidelines and best practices
* Create internal documentation for common patterns

== Performance Tuning

=== Optimization Techniques

```nu
# Use efficient patterns
$scripts | par-each { |script| $script | from posix } # Parallel processing

# Cache common conversions
const converted_patterns = {
    "ls -la": "ls -la",
    "cat file": "open file",
    # ... other patterns
}
```

=== Resource Management

* Monitor memory usage during large batch conversions
* Use appropriate timeouts for complex scripts
* Implement progress tracking for long-running operations
