= nu-posix Project Status

== Overview

The `nu-posix` project has been successfully created as a Nushell plugin that converts POSIX shell scripts to idiomatic Nushell syntax.
This document summarizes the current state of the project.

== Implementation Status

=== ✅ Completed Features

1. *Plugin Architecture*
   - Proper Nushell plugin structure using `nu-plugin` crate
   - Three main commands: `from posix`, `to posix`, `parse posix`
   - Compatible with Nushell 0.105

2. *POSIX Parser*
   - Simple line-by-line parsing approach
   - Handles basic commands, pipelines, and control structures
   - Parses variable assignments and operators
   - Supports comments and empty lines

3. *Command Conversion*
   - Converts common Unix commands to Nushell equivalents:
     * `echo` → `print`
     * `cat` → `open`
     * `ls` with flags → `ls` with Nushell flags
     * `grep` → `where` with regex matching
     * `head`/`tail` → `first`/`last`
     * `wc -l` → `length`

4. *Pipeline Conversion*
   - Basic pipeline transformation (`cmd1 | cmd2`)
   - AND/OR operators (`&&` → `and`, `||` → `or`)

5. *Control Structures*
   - Basic if/then/else statements
   - Simple for loops
   - Variable assignments

6. *Testing*
   - Comprehensive test suite with 11 tests
   - All tests passing
   - Covers parsing, conversion, and edge cases

=== ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. *POSIX Parser*
   - Uses simple string parsing instead of full POSIX syntax tree
   - `yash-syntax` integration deferred due to API complexity
   - Limited handling of complex shell constructs

2. *Conversion Scope*
   - Basic command mapping only
   - No support for advanced shell features like:
     * Complex parameter expansion
     * Here-documents
     * Background processes
     * Function definitions with parameters
     * Complex case statements

3. *Nushell Integration*
   - Plugin registration may have compatibility issues with different Nu versions
   - Limited testing with actual Nushell environment

== Technical Details

=== Dependencies

* `nu-plugin`: 0.105 (matches local Nushell version)
* `nu-protocol`: 0.105
* `anyhow`: 1.0 (error handling)
* `serde`: 1.0 (serialization)
* `serde_json`: 1.0 (JSON handling)
* `thiserror`: 1.0 (error types)

=== Build Status

* ✅ Compiles successfully
* ✅ All tests pass
* ✅ Plugin binary created
* ✅ Successfully registered with Nushell 0.105

== Commands Implemented

=== `from posix`

Converts POSIX shell script to Nushell syntax.

* Flags: `--pretty`, `--file`
* Input: String (POSIX script)
* Output: String (Nushell script)

=== `to posix`

Converts Nushell syntax to POSIX shell script (basic implementation).

* Input: String (Nushell script)
* Output: String (POSIX script)

=== `parse posix`

Parses POSIX shell script and returns AST as structured data.

* Input: String (POSIX script)
* Output: Record (AST structure)

== Testing Results

All 11 tests pass successfully:

* Parser tests: 7/7 ✅
* Converter tests: 4/4 ✅

Test coverage includes:

* Simple command parsing
* Pipeline parsing
* Control structure parsing
* Variable assignment parsing
* Command conversion
* Pipeline conversion
* If statement conversion
* Argument quoting

== Known Issues

1. *Plugin Registration*: ✅ Successfully resolved - plugin now works with Nu 0.105
2. *Parser Limitations*: Simple regex-based parsing vs. full POSIX grammar
3. *Conversion Coverage*: Limited command mapping compared to full POSIX spec

== Next Steps

=== Immediate (Priority 1)

1. ✅ Fixed Nushell version compatibility (now supports 0.105)
2. Add more comprehensive command mappings
3. Improve error handling and user feedback

=== Short-term (Priority 2)

1. Integrate proper POSIX parser (yash-syntax)
2. Add support for more control structures
3. Implement better variable expansion handling

=== Long-term (Priority 3)

1. Add interactive CLI mode
2. Support for complex shell constructs
3. Configuration system for conversion preferences
4. Integration with Nu package manager

== Development Environment

* *Language*: Rust (edition 2021)
* *Build System*: Cargo + Pixi
* *Target*: Nushell plugin ecosystem
* *Testing*: Built-in Rust test framework

== Documentation

* ✅ Comprehensive README.adoc
* ✅ Inline code documentation
* ✅ Example scripts
* ✅ Usage instructions
* ✅ API documentation

== Conclusion

The `nu-posix` project successfully demonstrates a working Nushell plugin for POSIX shell script conversion.
While the current implementation uses a simplified parser, it provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
The plugin architecture is correct, tests are comprehensive, and the basic conversion functionality works as designed.

The project is ready for:

1. Basic usage and testing
2. Community feedback
3. Incremental improvements
4. Integration with more sophisticated POSIX parsing libraries

*Status*: ✅ *MVP Complete* - Basic functionality working, ready for enhancement
